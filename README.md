# viral-hello-world
A NodeJS program that endlessly copies itself and prints "hello world" from each copy


This program:
1. reads its own source code
2. Then copies its own source code to a new file with a unique Id appended (to prevent filename errors).
3. Then it executes its own copy.
4. Repeat step 1. in an infinite loop
